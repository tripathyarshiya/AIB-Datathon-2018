# AIB-Datathon-2018
Conducted by Irish bank AIB. In theDatathon challenge, we are required to use analytical tools and machine learning models to solve an inclusion related problem. The challenge is not revealed until the day of the event.

The Challenge this year was separated into two problems:
(a) Language Identification Task
(b) Sentiment Analysis Task

** Please Note we carried out three different types of training for the sentiment analysis, and in the end we used the Sentiment Analysis 3 code for final submission as it had higher accuracy compared to other two methods.

The use of external datasets is permitted.
The use of external APIs is NOT permitted.

Task 1: Language Analysis: [dataset1]
The first part of the challenge is to build a model which auto classifies a piece of text with the correct language it was written in. With a file given of 7 different languages, the data will be one sentence per id. The file is encoded with UTF-8 encoding.
The 7 languages are as follows:
•	 ENGLISH,
•	 FRENCH,
•	 GERMAN,
•	 ITALIAN,
•	 PORTUGUESE,
•	 SPANISH,
•	 JAPANESE
The data is provided in the following file: Languages.csv with the following columns:
1.	ID - a unique id per row
2.	Text - the sentence 
3.	Language - a label determining the language of text.


Task 2: Language Analysis: [dataset2]
The second task will be to do sentiment classification of one language for positive & negative sentiment. The data is in the file called: Sentiment.csv, with the following columns:
1.	ID - a unique id per row
2.	Text - the sentence 
3.	Sentiment - a label determining the sentiment of text.
